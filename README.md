## How to use this bot:

1. Before starting the bot you should insert a line of code in the kolbot files at
`C:\Users\YOUR_USER\PATH\d2bs\kolbot\libs\common\Misc.js` at line ~1533 `D2Bot.printToItemLog(itemObj);` copy/paste below the following line of code:`D2Bot.saveItem(itemObj);`
2. Also you need to create a bot in Telegram using @BotFather in order to obtain the bot TOKEN to insert in the program when it asks
3. If you don't want to compile the code yourself, just run as admin the DiabloBot.exe in Compiled folder
4. After you finished the setup, the program will wait that you send a random message ("Hi", "Hello") to the bot and then it will appear the text "Running...", now you can minimize it and enjoy it
5. You MUST start .exe as Administrator if you want be able to start and stop the D2Bot from Telegram bot
6. Also you need to disable the notifications prompt when you try to open a program that requires Admin permission
Go to start and type "Change User Account Control settings", open it and slide down to "Never notifiy"

If you don't want to start and stop the D2Bot from Telegram bot just skip step 5 or if you know some other methods to avoid the step 5, please share with me so I can implement it
